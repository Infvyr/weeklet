# Requirements: Weeklet v1.1 — UX Polish

## Milestone v1.1 Requirements

### UI / UX

- [ ] **UX-01**: User sees a centered empty state when the expenses list is empty
- [ ] **UX-02**: PDF export action is hidden (not shown) when the expenses or income list is empty
- [ ] **UX-03**: User can access categories via an icon button in the expenses AppBar; categories is removed from bottom navigation
- [ ] **UX-04**: Annual evolution amount label fits on a single row without wrapping (stats screen)
- [ ] **UX-05**: A scrollbar is visible on all scrollable screens

### Localization

- [ ] **LOC-01**: All UI strings are translated for RO, RU, and EN; when the system locale is not ro, ru, or en, the app defaults to EN

## Future Requirements

*(Carry-forward from v1.0 — not in scope for v1.1)*

- **QUAL-01**: Unit tests for use cases and repositories
- **QUAL-02**: BLoC tests for all BLoC classes
- **BUDG-01**: User can set a monthly spending limit per category
- **BUDG-02**: User sees a warning when approaching or exceeding a spending limit
- **AUTO-01**: User can create recurring transactions that auto-populate on schedule
- **EXP-03**: User can export expenses as CSV
- **EXP-04**: User can export income as CSV

## Out of Scope

- Cloud sync / backend — local-first constraint
- Web target — iOS and Android only
- Multi-currency — single currency per user
- Onboarding flow — personal-use app, no acquisition funnel needed
- Empty state centering for income/categories screens — deferred, expenses only for v1.1
