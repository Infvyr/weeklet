## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Cloud sync / backend | Local-first is a core product constraint — no network infrastructure planned |
| Web target | Only iOS and Android are primary platforms |
| Multi-currency | Single currency per user; currency is a display setting, not multi-currency accounting |
| Onboarding flow | Not needed for personal-use launch; revisit if user acquisition becomes a goal |
