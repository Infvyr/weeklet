## Milestone: v1.1 — UX Polish

**Shipped:** 2026-05-03
**Phases:** 2 (08, 09) | **Plans:** 12 | **Sessions:** 3

### What Was Built

- **Phase 8 — UI Polish:** `formatCompact` (K-notation for amounts ≥ 1000), global `ScrollConfiguration` injection, 4-tab bottom navigation (Categories moved to AppBar icon), expenses empty state centering, PDF export hidden when list is empty, compact stats amounts.
- **Phase 9 — Localization:** `gen-l10n` infrastructure with `l10n.yaml` and 3 ARB files (145 keys × EN/RO/RU), trimmed `LocaleManager`, `localeResolutionCallback` English fallback, typed domain exceptions replacing all English error strings in the domain layer, full widget tree localization across 60+ files.

### What Worked

- **Parallel worktree execution:** Plans 09-03 and 09-04 ran in parallel worktrees without conflicts — they touched entirely different file sets. The post-merge gate caught the one overlap (`amount_field_view.dart`) cleanly.
- **TDD RED→GREEN discipline for Phase 9:** Wave 0 committed failing tests before implementation; all three test files turned GREEN exactly as planned.
- **Typed exception pattern:** Replacing use-case `ArgumentError`/English strings with enum-coded exceptions made the BLoC→widget translation switch clean and testable.
- **ARB parity enforced by automation:** Python parity check in plan 09-05 caught missing keys before human review.

### What Was Inefficient

- **Agent stream timeout (09-03):** The 09-03 executor stalled on the stream watchdog after committing expenses files but before completing categories and settings. Recovery required manually merging the worktree, resolving a conflict in `amount_field_view.dart`, and committing the leftover category files separately — ~30 min of cleanup.
- **09-04 agent committed to main branch directly:** The 09-04 agent bypassed its worktree and committed directly to `dev`. This created an unusual state where one worktree had uncommitted but valid changes while its worktree branch was at base. Root cause unclear (likely worktree lock during sequential dispatch).
- **REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes not auto-ticked:** The SDK marks phases complete but leaves `REQUIREMENTS.md` checkbox state unchanged. Required manual tick at milestone close.

### Patterns Established

- **BLoC emits error codes, widgets translate:** `actionError` carries ARB key names (e.g., `'errorBiometricFailed'`), never English sentences. Widget listeners use a `switch` to call `l10n.{key}`.
- **Bare `Locale` objects (no country codes):** `LocaleManager.supportedLocales` and all persisted locales use `Locale('en')` not `Locale('en', 'US')`. `Locale.==` requires exact match — country codes cause silent UI bugs (CR-01).
- **Required button labels in dialogs:** `CustomConfirmationDialog` `confirmButtonText`/`cancelButtonText` are `required` — callers must pass l10n strings. No English defaults.
- **`currencySymbol` passed explicitly:** `AmountFieldView` takes `required this.currencySymbol`. Forces all call sites to be intentional about the currency label shown.

### Key Lessons

1. **Stream watchdog timeouts are recoverable.** When an agent stalls mid-plan, check `git log` first — committed work is safe in the worktree. Run the merge manually, resolve conflicts, and commit leftover unstaged changes. Don't re-execute the full plan.
2. **Wave 2 parallel plans must have zero `files_modified` overlap.** The overlap check is critical — even a single shared file forces sequential execution. `amount_field_view.dart` was in both 09-03 and 09-04 plans but the overlap was caught at merge time, not planning time.
3. **Locale equality in Flutter is exact.** `Locale('en', 'US') != Locale('en')`. Use bare language codes everywhere — in `supportedLocales`, persisted state, and option lists.
4. **Code review found 2 critical bugs post-execution.** CR-01 (locale mismatch) and CR-02 (hardcoded English in BLoC) would have shipped to users without the review gate. The gsd-code-review step is worth keeping mandatory.

### Cost Observations

- Model: Claude Sonnet 4.6 (1M context) throughout
- Sessions: ~3 sessions across 4 days (limits hit during Phase 9 execution)
- Notable: 1M context window allowed rich prior-wave SUMMARY context to be passed to executor agents without trimming

## Milestone: v1.2 — Testing

**Shipped:** 2026-07-26
**Phases:** 4 (10–13) | **Plans:** 16 | **Sessions:** multiple across ~2 months

### What Was Built

- **Phase 10 — Use case tests:** validation (incl. TDD `CategoryValidationError.duplicateName` case-insensitive guard), delete success/not-found, year/month filter utils (TEST-01–08).
- **Phase 11 — BLoC tests:** all six BLoCs with `bloc_test`, shared `fake_blocs.dart`, per-test GetIt isolation for CRUD handlers that call `sl<StatsBloc>()` (TEST-09–15).
- **Phase 12 — Widget tests:** 5 screens + 2 form components via a shared `pumpApp` helper and mocktail BLoCs; all SettingsScreen toggles verified by real UI taps (TEST-16–23).
- **Phase 13 — Integration tests:** 4 real-Hive, widget-driven E2E flows (expense CRUD, income CRUD, stats refresh, PDF export) with byte-level PDF content verification via a hand-rolled extractor (TEST-24–27).

### What Worked

- **Real Hive over fakes for integration.** Phase 13 exercised the actual persistence + DI graph (harness mirrors `service_locator.dart` registration-for-registration), so integration tests proved real wiring instead of re-verifying BLoC logic already covered by unit tests.
- **Assert what the user sees.** CRUD flows driven by real widget taps (never direct BLoC dispatch, D-01) and stats proven via the visible Stats-tab balance (D-03) — tests survive internal refactors.
- **Independent verification paid off.** The Phase 13 verifier re-ran the full suite itself (169/169) rather than trusting SUMMARY narration, catching the premature `requirements-completed` marking in 13-01's frontmatter.
- **Equatable-aware seeding.** Repeated pattern across StatsBloc/SettingsBloc: seed with a *distinct* prior state so a no-op transition still emits — otherwise `bloc_test` sees `[]` and fails confusingly.

### What Was Inefficient

- **`TestWidgetsFlutterBinding` hangs on real `dart:io` Hive writes.** Root-causing why integration tests hung forever cost real time before landing on `LiveTestWidgetsFlutterBinding()` — a non-obvious requirement now documented as a project decision.
- **No pure-Dart PDF text extractor exists.** Had to hand-roll `extractPdfText` (zlib inflate + Tj/TJ regex) because no suitable FFI-free package is on pub.dev — worked, but was unplanned effort.
- **`const` churn in domain tests.** Multiple plans hit `const` compile errors (`DateTime` has no const constructor; `late` repository vars aren't const) — the planner's snippets used `const` liberally and each executor had to strip it.

### Patterns Established

- **Real-Hive test harness:** `test/helpers/test_hive_env.dart` provides `initTestDi()`/`teardownTestDi()` with a temp-dir Hive and full DI graph; the canonical way to write an integration test in this repo.
- **Platform fakes for file/share:** `_TestTempPathProvider implements PathProviderPlatform` + `FakeSharePlatform extends SharePlatform` avoid `MissingPluginException` in PDF export/share tests.
- **Concrete fake BLoCs for GetIt:** fakes must `extend` the concrete BLoC type (e.g. `FakeStatsBloc extends StatsBloc`) — not bare `Bloc<E,S>` — so `sl<ConcreteBloc>()` registrations resolve.

### Key Lessons

1. **The verifier must run the suite, not read the summary.** Independent re-execution is what separates "claimed done" from "done" — it caught a premature completion marking that source-of-truth checkboxes would have hidden.
2. **REQUIREMENTS.md checkbox drift persists across milestones.** As in v1.1, execution left 21/27 boxes unticked despite passing tests. The milestone audit + archive step is the reliable place to reconcile — don't trust checkbox state as coverage evidence.
3. **Process artifacts lagged the work.** Phases 10 & 11 shipped passing tests but no `VERIFICATION.md`/`VALIDATION.md`. Verified-by-execution ≠ verified-by-artifact; if the audit trail matters, run `/gsd:verify-work` per phase during execution, not retroactively.
4. **Fix review findings before they compound.** All four 13-REVIEW warnings were addressed in small, atomic `fix(13)` commits right after verification — cheap because the context was fresh.

### Cost Observations

- Model: Claude Opus / Sonnet (1M context)
- Sessions: multiple across ~2 months (2026-05-21 → 2026-07-26)
- Notable: longest-running milestone by calendar time, but purely additive (63 files, +11,626/−90) — no production behavior changed, so regression risk was contained to the test layer itself.

## Cross-Milestone Trends

### Process Evolution

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Key Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|------------|
| v1.0 | 7 | 21 | Initial GSD setup; single-agent sequential execution |
| v1.1 | 2 | 12 | Parallel worktree execution for Wave 2; mandatory code review gate |
| v1.2 | 4 | 16 | Wave-based test authoring; independent verifier re-runs suite; real-Hive integration harness |

### Cumulative Quality

| Milestone | Tests | Zero-Dep Domain | Typed Errors |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| v1.0 | 34 (use case + export) | ✓ | ArgumentError (partial) |
| v1.1 | 34 (stable) | ✓ | Typed exception enums (complete) |
| v1.2 | 169 (use case + BLoC + widget + integration) | ✓ | Typed exception enums (complete) |

### Top Lessons (Verified Across Milestones)

1. **Domain layer must stay Flutter-free.** Any Flutter import in `lib/domain/` is a red flag — it breaks testability and localization.
2. **Code review gate catches production bugs.** Two milestones, two mandatory reviews — both found critical issues that automated tests missed.
3. **Stream timeouts are recoverable, not catastrophic.** Committed work survives; the recovery path (manual merge + leftover commit) is well-understood.
4. **REQUIREMENTS.md checkbox state is not coverage evidence.** Two milestones running (v1.1, v1.2), execution left requirement boxes unticked despite passing work. Reconcile at the milestone audit/archive step; verify against the actual codebase, never the checkboxes.
5. **Verify by execution, and record the artifact.** v1.2 proved coverage by re-running the suite, but two phases shipped without `VERIFICATION.md`. Passing tests ≠ complete audit trail — produce the verification artifact during the phase if the record matters.
